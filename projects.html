        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
        <p>The website you are using right now was coded from scratch by me. I used HTML and CSS for the general layout and styling, and will update it as I learn more about web development!</p>

        <h3>Scribble Dungeon</h3>
        <p>Scribble Dungeon is a browser-based web game currently being made by my friends and I. I am in charge of the backend game logic, which I am writing in Python. You can check out our project <a href="https://github.com/Jaerdon/ScribbleDungeon">on GitHub</a> or some screenshots below:</p>

        <h3>Discord Server Manager Bot</h3>
        <p>This is a discord bot I programmed entirely in Python. It allows users to easily start, stop, and check the status of dedicated game servers. The code is <a href="https://github.com/Phreakester/discord-bot-server-manager">on GitHub</a>, as well as instructions on how to set it up with your favorite game!</p>
