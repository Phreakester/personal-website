# personal-website
A personal website to act as a sort of portfolio to display my projects/ accomplishments
Main Idea:
The final vision (which will require much more knowledge of web design) is to have the website play out like opening a theme park map.
There will be different areas, each corresponding to a different area EX: CS, MECHE, TED, About Me, etc.
The home page will be in the Disneyland map style, with different boxes showing what is contained in each area
Each area will have a theme that mirrors disneyland: tomorrowland(CS), adventureland(blog), main street(about Me), fantasyland (drawing/music) etc.(will have to fit MechE in somewhere)
Each area will also have music and artwork to accompany it
